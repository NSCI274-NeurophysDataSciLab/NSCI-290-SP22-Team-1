    "The purpose of this notebook is to explore the dF/F traces from the data we have broken up into sex, cell type, and image type. We want to first plot the dF/F traces to see exactly what they look like and see what the code looks like to include these traces. We want to see if we can figure out averaging the dF/F traces for males and females respectively so we can see what the group as a whole looks like so that we may see about differences of spikes in different time points.

    "5. Use the traces to understand how many animals are being presented. (Done after creating the traces)\n",
    "5. Use this assessment (what we understand from it) to try to code individual animal traces if an average is not present. (Done after creating the traces)\n",

    "We expect to build successful traces of all animals overlayed on each other. We also expect to be able to breakdown the traces to see if what is shown on the original trace (is it all individual animals or is it an average of all animals?). If it is individual animals, we expect to be able to average these traces into a single trace to represent each data set. If time permits and it is an average presented, we expect to use these traces to create figures of inhibitory neuronal activity when viewing novel images and inhibitory neuronal activity when viewing familiar images that contains the male trace and female trace overlayed.
