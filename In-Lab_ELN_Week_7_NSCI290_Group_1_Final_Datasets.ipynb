    "The objective of this notebook is to breakdown the very broad dataset provided by Allen Brain Institute Atlas data into the specific datasets we want to focus on (VIP inhibitory neuron data of males when viewing familiar images, VIP inhibitory neuron data of females when viewing familiar images, VIP inhibitory neuron data of males when viewing novel images, and VIP inhibitory neuron data of females when viewing novel images). This will allow us to get a good idea of how many data points we are working with as well as get an idea of how our figure 1 panels may look (since this was focused on the breakdown of our data into the final datasets).

    "## Protocol:\n",
    "1. Import allensdk data \n",
    "2. Filter and save sessions by sex (one list for males, one list for females).\n",
    "3. Breakdown the data into excitatory and inhibitory neuron data.\n",
    "4. Save all information of inhibitory neuron trials: one for males and one for females.\n",
    "5. Analyze the data into VISp ONLY data points.\n",
    "6. Further breakdown these lists into 2 lists each: one containing data when viewing novel images and one containing data when viewing familiar images.\n",
    "7. Trouble shoot any failures with syntax/errors. \n",
    "8. If we finish early and everything works, we will look to see if we should focus on the depth of the cells within the V1 area as another variable. (need to see amount of depths in each sex and and how much data falls into each depth per sex). "

    "## Expected Results:\n",
    "We expect to find a good amount of data in each category listed in the objective above. These numbers should be more than 5 (which we consider to be quite small of an n) but will not be outrageous numbers (like over 1000 data points to work with). Having these data sets broken down and defined gives us a much better understanding of what we are actually working with and will allow us to further narrow/expand the borders of our research as needed."
